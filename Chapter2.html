<h1 style="color:blue"><b>CHAPTER 2 - HISTORY OF COMPUTER</b></h1>

<p>The first counting device was used by the primitive people. They used sticks, stones and
bones as counting tools. As human mind and technology improved with time more
computing devices were developed. Some of the popular computing devices starting with
the first to recent ones are described below;
</p>

<h4 style="color:red"><b>ABACUS</b></h4>
<p>The history of computer begins with the birth of abacus which is believed to be the first
computer. It is said that Chinese invented Abacus around 4,000 years ago.
It was a wooden rack which has metal rods with beads mounted on them. The beads were
moved by the abacus operator according to some rules to perform arithmetic calculations.
Abacus is still used in some countries like China, Russia and Japan. An image of this tool is
shown below;

<h4 style="color:red"><b>NAPIER'S BONES</b></h4>
<p>It was a manually-operated calculating device which was invented by John Napier (1550-1617) of Merchiston. In this calculating tool,
he used 9 different ivory strips or bones marked with numbers to multiply and divide. So, the tool became known as "Napier's Bones.
It was also the first machine to use the decimal point.

<h4 style="color:red"><b>PASCALINE</b></h4>
<p>Pascaline is also known as Arithmetic Machine or Adding Machine. It was
invented between 1642 and 1644 by a French mathematician-philosopher Biaise
Pascal. It is believed that it was the first mechanical and automatic calculator.
Pascal invented this machine to help his father, a tax accountant. It could only
perform addition and subtraction. It was a wooden box with a series of gears and
wheels. When a wheel is rotated one revolution, it rotates the neighboring wheel.
A series of windows is given on the top of the wheels to read the totals. An
image of this tool is shown below;

<h4 style="color:red"><b>Stepped Reckoner or Leibnitz wheel</b></h4>
<p>It was developed by a German mathematician-philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibnitz in 1673. He improved Pascal's invention to develop this machine. It was a
digital mechanical calculator which was called the stepped reckoner as instead of
gears it was made of fluted drums. See the following image;

<h4 style="color:red"><b>DIFFERENCE ENGINE</b></h4>
<p>In the early 1820s, it was designed by Charles Babbage who is known as "Father
of Modern Computer". It was a mechanical computer which could perform
simple calculations. It was a steam driven calculating machine designed to solve
tables of numbers like logarithm tables.

<h4 style="color:red"><b>ANALYTICAL ENGINE</b></h4>
<p>This calculating machine was also developed by Charles Babbage in 1830. It was
a mechanical computer that used punch-cards as input. It was capable of solving
any mathematical problem and storing information as a permanent memory.

<h4 style="color:red"><b>TABULATING MACHINE</b></h4>
<p>It was invented in 1890, by Herman Hollerith, an American statistician. It was a
mechanical tabulator based on punch cards. It could tabulate statistics and
record or sort data or information. This machine was used in the 1890 U.S.
Census. Hollerith also started the Hollerith?s Tabulating Machine Company which
later became International Business Machine (IBM) in 1924.

<h4 style="color:red"><b>DIFFERENTIAL ANALYZER</b></h4>
<p>It was the first electronic computer introduced in the United States in 1930. It was
an analog device invented by Vannevar Bush. This machine has vacuum tubes to
switch electrical signals to perform calculations. It could do 25 calculations in few minutes.

<h4 style="color:red"><b>MARK 1</b></h4>
<p>The next major changes in the history of computer began in 1937 when Howard
Aiken planned to develop a machine that could perform calculations involving
large numbers. In 1944, Mark I computer was built as a partnership between IBM
and Harvard. It was the first programmable digital computer.
