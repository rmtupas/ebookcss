<h1 style="color:blue"><b>CHAPTER 3 - TYPES OF COMPUTER</b></h1>

<h4><b><center>On the basis of data handling capabilities, the computer is of three types:</center></b></h4>

<h4 style="color:red"><b>ANALOG COMPUTER</b></h4>
<p>Analogue computers are designed to process analogue data. Analogue data is
continuous data that changes continuously and cannot have discrete values. We
can say that analogue computers are used where we don't need exact values
always such as speed, temperature, pressure and current.
</p>

<h4 style="color:red"><b>DIGITAL COMPUTER</b></h4>
<p>Digital computer is designed to perform calculations and logical operations at
high speed. It accepts the raw data as input in the form of digits or binary
numbers (0 and 1) and processes it with programs stored in its memory to
produce the output. All modern computers like laptops, desktops including
smartphones that we use at home or office are digital computers.
</p>

<h4 style="color:red"><b>HYBRID COMPUTER</b></h4>
<p>Hybrid computer has features of both analogue and digital computer. It is<b><i> fast
like an analogue</b></i> computer and has memory and <b><i>accuracy like digital
computers</b></i>. It can process both continuous and discrete data. It accepts analogue
signals and convert them into digital form before processing. So, it is widely used
in specialized applications where both analogue and digital data is processed.
For example, a processor is used in petrol pumps that converts the
measurements of fuel flow into quantity and price. Similarly, they are used in
airplanes, hospitals, and scientific applications.

<h4><b><center>On the basis of size, the computer can be of five types:</center></b></h4>

<h4 style="color:red"><b>1) Supercomputer</b></h4>
<p>Supercomputers are the <b><i>biggest and fastest computers</b></i>. They are designed to
process huge amount of data. A supercomputer can <b><i>process trillions of
instructions in a second</b></i>. It has thousands of interconnected processors.
Supercomputers are particularly used in  <b><i>scientific and engineering
applications</b></i> such as weather forecasting, scientific simulations and nuclear
energy research. The first supercomputer was developed by <b><i>Roger Cray in 1976</b></i>.
</p>

<h4 style="color:red"><b>2) Mainframe Computer</b></h4>
<p>Mainframe computers are designed to support hundreds or thousands of users
simultaneously. They can support multiple programs at the same time. It means
they can execute different processes simultaneously. These features of mainframe
computers make them ideal for big organizations like banking and telecom
sectors, which need to manage and process high volume of data.

means they can execute different processes simultaneously. These features of
mainframe computers make them ideal for big organizations like banking and
telecom sectors, which need to manage and process a high volume of data that
requires integer operations such as indexing, comparisons, etc.
</p>

<h4 style="color:red"><b>3) Miniframe or Minicomputer</b></h4>
<p>It is a <b><i>midsize multiprocessing computer</b></i>. It consists of two or more processors
and can support <b><i>4 to 200 users at one time</b></i>. Miniframe computers are used in
institutes and departments for tasks such as billing, accounting and inventory
management. A minicomputer <b><i>lies between the mainframe and
microcomputer</b></i> as it is smaller than mainframe but larger than a microcomputer.
</p>

<h4 style="color:red"><b>4) Workstation</b></h4>
<p>Workstation is a <b><i>single user computer</b></i> that is designed for <b><i>technical or
scientific applications</b></i>. It has a faster microprocessor, a large amount of RAM
and high speed graphic adapters. It generally<b><i> performs a specific job with great
expertise</b></i>; accordingly, they are of different types such as graphics workstation,
music workstation and engineering design workstation.
</p>

<h4 style="color:red"><b>5) Microcomputer</b></h4>
<p>Microcomputer is also known as a personal computer. It is a general-purpose
computer that is designed for individual use. It has a microprocessor as a central
processing unit, memory, storage area, input unit and output unit. Laptops and
desktop computers are examples of microcomputers. They are suitable for
personal work that may be making an assignment, watching a movie, or at office
for office work.
